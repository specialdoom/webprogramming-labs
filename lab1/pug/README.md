# Node.js: A Versatile JavaScript Runtime Environment

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it ideal for building various types of applications, including:

* **Server-side scripting:** Build performant and scalable web applications with frameworks like Express.js and NestJS.
* **Command-line tools:** Create CLI utilities for automation and interaction with the system.
* **Real-time applications:** Develop applications requiring real-time communication, like chat applications or collaborative editing tools.
* **IoT applications:** Node.js is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices used in the Internet of Things.

**Key Features:**

* **Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model:** Enables handling multiple requests concurrently, improving performance and scalability.
* **JavaScript everywhere:** Leverage the vast ecosystem of JavaScript libraries and tools across different environments.
* **Large and active community:** Benefit from extensive documentation, tutorials, and support from a vast developer community.
* **Package manager (npm):** Access a rich repository of pre-built modules and tools to streamline development.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Download and Install:** Download the latest Node.js installer from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. **Verify Installation:** Open a terminal and run `node -v` to check the installed Node.js version.
3. **Write your first Node.js script:** Create a file with the `.js` extension (e.g., `app.js`) and write your code:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

4. **Run the script:** Use `node app.js` in the terminal to execute your code.
